I tackled the task of automating web data retrieval from the Sauce Demo website. Here's a concise summary:


    Setup: Configured the development environment with Selenium and dotenv.

    Automation: Used Selenium to automate login, handle CAPTCHA challenges, and retrieve inventory data.

    Challenges: Addressed issues with CAPTCHA detection and asynchronous loading.

    Solutions: Implemented robust error handling and user prompts for manual intervention.

    Outcome: Successfully created a reliable and user-friendly automation script for data retrieval.
    

This approach ensured efficient and accurate retrieval of inventory data while handling potential challenges seamlessly.
